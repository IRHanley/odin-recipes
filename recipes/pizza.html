    <h2>Italian Pizza Pie</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>1 ball Best PIzza Dough (or Food Processor Dough or Thin Crush Dough)</p>
    <p>1/3 cup Best Homade Pizza Sauce.</p>
    <p>3/4 cup shreded mozzasrella cheese or 2 to 3 ounces fresh mozzarella.</p>
    <p>3 tablespoons Best Basil Pesto or Basil Cashew Pesto.</p>
    <p>Semolian flower or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel.</p>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>1. Make the pizza dough: Follow the Best Pizza Dough recipe to prepare the dough. (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest.)</p>
    <p>2. Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven (here’s the pizza oven we use).</p>
    <p>3. Make the pizza sauce: Make the 5 Minute Pizza Sauce.</p>
    <p>4. Prepare the cheese: If using fresh mozzarella cheese, slice it into ¼ inch thick pieces (see the photo). If it’s incredibly watery fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), you may want to let it sit on a paper towel to remove moisture for about 15 minutes then dab the mozzarella with the paper towel to remove any additional moisture.</p>
    <p>5. Bake the pizza: When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don’t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle; see How to Stretch Pizza Dough for instructions. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel. </p>
    <p>6. Spread the pizza sauce over the dough using the back of a spoon to create a thin layer. Add the mozzarella cheese. Top with a few pinches of kosher salt.</p>
    <p>7. Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven).</p>
    <p>8. Dollop with the basil pesto. Slice into pieces and serve immediately.</p>
